# Linked Lists

Linked List applied the dynamical storage allocation.

A linked list is a chain of **nodes**, each containing a pointer to the next node. 

The advantages of a linked list \(comparing to an array\) are: can easily insert or delete an instance and grow or shrink the size. 

But the disadvantage is losing the function of accessing by index or position.
