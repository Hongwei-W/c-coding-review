# The Preprocessor

The preprocessor is a part of the compiler \(gcc\) that edits a C program before the compilation. It deals with **directives**, which has:

* File inclusion by `#include`;
* Macro definition by `#define`, `#undef`;
* Conditional compilation by `#if`, `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#elif`, `#else`, `#endif`.

The output generated by the preprocessor is another program that contains no directives, and it goes straight into the compiler.

There are certain rules for writing these directives, they

* always start with `#`;
* have different meanings if spaces and tabs are added in the middle;
* end with the first `\n`, unless continued by `\`;
* can appear anywhere, and can be effective immediately afterward
* can have comments as usual
